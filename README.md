# OperatingSystemsProject2
In an operating system, each process has specific memory requirements. These memory requirements are met (or not) based on whether free memory is available to fulfill such requirements. In this second project, you will simulate both contiguous and non-contiguous memory allocation schemes. For contiguous memory allocation, we will use a dynamic memory allocation scheme.
